Using an abundance co-variance strategy, we group highly co-varying genes into MetaGenomic Species, which represent a wide range of biological entities: bacterial genomes, plasmids, genomic islands, clonal variation and bacteriophages. Applying this concept to a new 3.9 million microbial gene catalogue derived from 396 human stool samples we identified 7,381 such MetaGenomic Species. They range in size from 3 to 6,319 genes, with 741 MetaGenomic Species resembling bacterial genomes in number of genes contained. The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria. A large proportion (73%) of the MetaGenomic Species displays no sequence similarity to any previously sequenced organism. Smaller MetaGenomic Species are enriched for genes characteristic for bacteriophages and functions important for biotic interactions and show strong dependencies to gene-rich MetaGenomic Species. We present the first unsupervised structuring of a highly complex series of metagenomic samples into biological entities, including a global analysis of the genetic interdependencies between bacteria, plasmids, phages and genetic islands in the human distal gut.",,2016-01-17T15:32:21.353Z,2016-01-17T15:32:21.353Z

Representatives of this genus naturally colonize the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and are important for establishing and maintaining homeostasis of the intestinal ecosystem to allow for normal digestion. Their presence has been associated with beneficial health effects, such as prevention of diarrhea, amelioration of lactose intolerance, or immunomodulation. The stabilizing effect on GIT microflora is attributed to the capacity of bifidobacteria to produce bacteriocins, which are bacteriostatic agents with a broad spectrum of action, and to their pH-reducing activity. Most of the ~30 known species of bifidobacteria have been isolated from the mammalian GIT, and some from the vaginal and oral cavity. All are obligate anaerobes belonging to the Actinomycetales, branch of Gram-positive bacteria with high GC content that also includes Corynebacteria, Mycobacteria, and Streptomycetes.Bifidobacterium bifidum. Bifidobacterium bifidum is commonly isolated from human feces and is used a a probiotic to maintain healthy gut flora.Bifidobacterium bifidum DSM 20456.  Bifidobacterium bifidum DSM 20456 (ATCC 27723) was isolated from the feces of a breast-fed infant and is a member of normal human gut microbial community. This strain is the type strain and is part of a comprehensive, sequence-based survey of members of the normal human gut microbiota of children and adults. A joint effort of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at Washington University School of Medicine, the purpose of this survey is to provide the general scientific community with a broad view of the gene content of 100 representatives of the major divisions represented in the intestine's microbial community. This information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome.   ",,2014-12-08T22:10:27.936Z,2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z

Using an abundance co-variance strategy, we group highly co-varying genes into MetaGenomic Species, which represent a wide range of biological entities: bacterial genomes, plasmids, genomic islands, clonal variation and bacteriophages. Applying this concept to a new 3.9 million microbial gene catalogue derived from 396 human stool samples we identified 7,381 such MetaGenomic Species. They range in size from 3 to 6,319 genes, with 741 MetaGenomic Species resembling bacterial genomes in number of genes contained. The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria. A large proportion (73%) of the MetaGenomic Species displays no sequence similarity to any previously sequenced organism. Smaller MetaGenomic Species are enriched for genes characteristic for bacteriophages and functions important for biotic interactions and show strong dependencies to gene-rich MetaGenomic Species. We present the first unsupervised structuring of a highly complex series of metagenomic samples into biological entities, including a global analysis of the genetic interdependencies between bacteria, plasmids, phages and genetic islands in the human distal gut.",,2016-01-17T15:32:34.140Z,2016-01-17T15:32:34.140Z

Thus, the sterile urine paradigm is no longer valid. In an effort to provide a comprehensive view of the newly discovered female urinary microbiota (FUM), we have established an Enhanced Quantitative Urine Culture (EQUC) protocol. EQUC isolates bacteria from 75-90% of urine samples deemed no growth by the standard clinical microbiology urine culture method. We have begun to sequence and annotate the genomes of these isolated bacteria.",,2018-05-25T12:52:54.208Z,2018-05-25T12:52:54.208Z

Using an abundance co-variance strategy, we group highly co-varying genes into MetaGenomic Species, which represent a wide range of biological entities: bacterial genomes, plasmids, genomic islands, clonal variation and bacteriophages. Applying this concept to a new 3.9 million microbial gene catalogue derived from 396 human stool samples we identified 7,381 such MetaGenomic Species. They range in size from 3 to 6,319 genes, with 741 MetaGenomic Species resembling bacterial genomes in number of genes contained. The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria. A large proportion (73%) of the MetaGenomic Species displays no sequence similarity to any previously sequenced organism. Smaller MetaGenomic Species are enriched for genes characteristic for bacteriophages and functions important for biotic interactions and show strong dependencies to gene-rich MetaGenomic Species. We present the first unsupervised structuring of a highly complex series of metagenomic samples into biological entities, including a global analysis of the genetic interdependencies between bacteria, plasmids, phages and genetic islands in the human distal gut.",,2016-01-17T15:31:17.714Z,2016-01-17T15:31:17.714Z
