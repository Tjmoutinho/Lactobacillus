Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential.

This led to the identification of a catalase-encoding gene in all ten L. casei sensu stricto strains making it the first described catalase-positive species in the Lactobacillus genus. Moreover, we found that six out of ten L. casei genomes contained a SecA2/SecY2 gene cluster with two putative glycosylated surface adhesin proteins.

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.",sample_type:bacterial culture,2017-11-23T08:17:17.337Z,2017-11-23T08:17:17.337Z

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.",sample_type:bacterial culture,2017-11-23T08:19:42.036Z,2017-11-23T08:19:42.036Z

Then, we compared the its transcriptome of the strain L. plantarum A6when grown in a food matrix made from pearl millet to its transcriptome when the strain is cultivated into culture medium using next generation sequencing. Genomic comparison with the strains L. plantarum WCFS1, ST-III, JDM1 and ATCC14917 allowed the identification of 362 coding sequences specific to L. plantarum A6. Furthermore, Ggenes coding important functions important for nutritional quality of the food have also been identified:, such as those involved in metabolism of polyphenols , have been identified. Some complete biosynthetic biosynthesis pathways such asof folate among others.and their expression has been characterized. In addition, Cconsidering its interest as efficiency as an amylolytic bacteriastrain, we investigated all genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, giving special attention to starch metabolism. An extracellular alpha amylase, a neopullulanase and the maltodextrin transporters are were identified and were all highly expressed in food matrix.The combination of genomic and transcriptomic not only revealed undocumented nutritional properties of L. plantarum A6, but also documented the behaviour of this bacteria in food.",,2017-11-24T17:34:29.824Z,2017-11-24T17:34:29.824Z

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.",sample_type:bacterial culture,2017-11-23T08:20:15.300Z,2017-11-23T08:20:15.300Z

Among more than 200 different LAB strains isolated from artisanal fermented food products in Laboratory of Antibiotic, Enzyme, Probiotic and Starter Culture Technologies, Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology University of Zagreb, only few of Lactobacillus strains are found to possess S-layer proteins on the cell surface, among which Lactobacillus helveticus M92, Lactobacillus brevis ZG1, Lactobacillus brevis SF9B and Lactobacillus brevis SF15B. Importance of S-layer proteins lies in increasing scientific evidences that some probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as enhanced survival in rigorous conditions in gastrointestinal tract and during the process of freeze-drying, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of pathogens, are related to the occurrence of those proteins. Hence, it is believed that the production of S-layer proteins might be a selective criterion indicating probiotic effect of Lactobacillus species that express those specific surface proteins. Another feature specific to certain strains of LAB, which gives them a selective advantage when applied as probiotic or starter cultures, is the production of bacteriocins. Among all the isolated autochthonous LAB, three Lactobaillus plantarum strains, M92C, SF15C and D13, showed advanced bacteriocinogenic potential. Besides their application as probiotics, these strains could be considered as starter cultures with potential to improve the functionality and quality of various fermented products, while in the same time preserving their traditional sensory characteristics.",sample_type:bacterial culture,2017-11-23T08:20:22.336Z,2017-11-23T08:20:22.336Z

Using an abundance co-variance strategy, we group highly co-varying genes into MetaGenomic Species, which represent a wide range of biological entities: bacterial genomes, plasmids, genomic islands, clonal variation and bacteriophages. Applying this concept to a new 3.9 million microbial gene catalogue derived from 396 human stool samples we identified 7,381 such MetaGenomic Species. They range in size from 3 to 6,319 genes, with 741 MetaGenomic Species resembling bacterial genomes in number of genes contained. The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria. A large proportion (73%) of the MetaGenomic Species displays no sequence similarity to any previously sequenced organism. Smaller MetaGenomic Species are enriched for genes characteristic for bacteriophages and functions important for biotic interactions and show strong dependencies to gene-rich MetaGenomic Species. We present the first unsupervised structuring of a highly complex series of metagenomic samples into biological entities, including a global analysis of the genetic interdependencies between bacteria, plasmids, phages and genetic islands in the human distal gut.",,2016-01-17T15:31:23.646Z,2016-01-17T15:31:23.646Z

Using an abundance co-variance strategy, we group highly co-varying genes into MetaGenomic Species, which represent a wide range of biological entities: bacterial genomes, plasmids, genomic islands, clonal variation and bacteriophages. Applying this concept to a new 3.9 million microbial gene catalogue derived from 396 human stool samples we identified 7,381 such MetaGenomic Species. They range in size from 3 to 6,319 genes, with 741 MetaGenomic Species resembling bacterial genomes in number of genes contained. The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria. A large proportion (73%) of the MetaGenomic Species displays no sequence similarity to any previously sequenced organism. Smaller MetaGenomic Species are enriched for genes characteristic for bacteriophages and functions important for biotic interactions and show strong dependencies to gene-rich MetaGenomic Species. We present the first unsupervised structuring of a highly complex series of metagenomic samples into biological entities, including a global analysis of the genetic interdependencies between bacteria, plasmids, phages and genetic islands in the human distal gut.",,2016-01-17T15:32:21.353Z,2016-01-17T15:32:21.353Z

Candidate strains are isolated from fecal samples after being enriched with the respective prebiotic. To test the potential of IVS, we isolated bifidobacteria by selective culture from human subjects after galactooligosaccharides (GOS) consumption . A retrospective analysis of the fecal microbiota of one of the subjects revealed that one strain, Bifidobacterium adolescentis IVS-1, was enriched 8-fold.

Representatives of this genus naturally colonize the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and are important for establishing and maintaining homeostasis of the intestinal ecosystem to allow for normal digestion. Their presence has been associated with beneficial health effects, such as prevention of diarrhea, amelioration of lactose intolerance, or immunomodulation. The stabilizing effect on GIT microflora is attributed to the capacity of bifidobacteria to produce bacteriocins, which are bacteriostatic agents with a broad spectrum of action, and to their pH-reducing activity. Most of the ~30 known species of bifidobacteria have been isolated from the mammalian GIT, and some from the vaginal and oral cavity. All are obligate anaerobes belonging to the Actinomycetales, branch of Gram-positive bacteria with high GC content that also includes Corynebacteria, Mycobacteria, and Streptomycetes.Bifidobacterium bifidum. Bifidobacterium bifidum is commonly isolated from human feces and is used a a probiotic to maintain healthy gut flora.Bifidobacterium bifidum DSM 20456.

Using an abundance co-variance strategy, we group highly co-varying genes into MetaGenomic Species, which represent a wide range of biological entities: bacterial genomes, plasmids, genomic islands, clonal variation and bacteriophages. Applying this concept to a new 3.9 million microbial gene catalogue derived from 396 human stool samples we identified 7,381 such MetaGenomic Species. They range in size from 3 to 6,319 genes, with 741 MetaGenomic Species resembling bacterial genomes in number of genes contained. The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria. A large proportion (73%) of the MetaGenomic Species displays no sequence similarity to any previously sequenced organism. Smaller MetaGenomic Species are enriched for genes characteristic for bacteriophages and functions important for biotic interactions and show strong dependencies to gene-rich MetaGenomic Species. We present the first unsupervised structuring of a highly complex series of metagenomic samples into biological entities, including a global analysis of the genetic interdependencies between bacteria, plasmids, phages and genetic islands in the human distal gut.",,2016-01-17T15:32:34.140Z,2016-01-17T15:32:34.140Z

The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria. A large proportion (73%) of the MetaGenomic Species displays no sequence similarity to any previously sequenced organism. Smaller MetaGenomic Species are enriched for genes characteristic for bacteriophages and functions important for biotic interactions and show strong dependencies to gene-rich MetaGenomic Species. We present the first unsupervised structuring of a highly complex series of metagenomic samples into biological entities, including a global analysis of the genetic interdependencies between bacteria, plasmids, phages and genetic islands in the human distal gut.",,2016-01-17T15:31:17.714Z,2016-01-17T15:31:17.714Z
